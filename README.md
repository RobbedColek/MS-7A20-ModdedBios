# MS-7A20-ModdedBios
BIOS for MSI X99A Gaming Pro Carbon (MS-7A20) with latest Intel microcodes. Based on 7A20v14.

# Why?
MSI stopped supporting this motherboard with BIOS updates some time ago, but new microcode updates for Broadwell-E are still coming out. I've decided to update existing BIOS with latest microcode and upload it here.

I had issue with overclock working on my Windows 10 after update KB4100347 - updating the microcode of BIOS fixed this issue among other things.
